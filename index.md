# About Me

I am now a PhD student in the [Perceptual User Interfaces group](https://perceptualui.org), [Institute for Visualisation and Interactive Systems](https://www.vis.uni-stuttgart.de) at [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de), supervised by [Professor Andreas Bulling](https://perceptualui.org/people/bulling/). I got my master's degree in computer science and technology from [Department of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018/index.html), supervised by [Professor Yong-jin Liu](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/~Yongjin/Yongjin.htm) in June 2020, and a bachelor's degree in computer science and technology from the [School of Computer Science](https://scs.bupt.edu.cn/) at [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/) in June 2017.

My research interests include affective computing, wearable sensing and applied machine learning. I would like to decode human behaviors and cognitions, and design personalized interfaces.
