## About Me

I am a third-year master student in the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018/index.html), supervised by [Professor Yong-jin Liu](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/~Yongjin/Yongjin.htm). Before joining Tsinghua,
I obtained my bachelor's degree in computer science and technology from the [School of Computer Science](https://scs.bupt.edu.cn/) at [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/).

My research interests include human-computer interaction, ubiquitous computing, wearable sensing, affective computing and machine learning. I want to apply the above technologies to healthcare, access and human behavior decoding to assist the vulnerable groups.

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
